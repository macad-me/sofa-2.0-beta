## Important Concepts

### Software Update Deferrals
Organizations can delay the visibility of updates to users:
- **Major OS Updates**: Can be deferred up to 90 days
- **Minor Updates**: Typically 30-60 day deferral window
- **Security Updates**: Should be installed promptly (7-14 days)

### CVE Management
**CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** tracking is critical:
- Monitor actively exploited vulnerabilities (KEV)
- Prioritize patches for critical systems
- Document remediation timelines
- Test updates before deployment
