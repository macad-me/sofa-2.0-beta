# Supporting the MacAdmins Open Source Organization 

The Mac Admins Open Source (MAOS) organization supports the development, code signing and hosting of many projects which are widely used within the community.

As part of our involvement in the Mac Admin community, **we will now accept sponsorships** and use the funds to support our mission of providing code signing and support for various projects. In addition, we will use part of the funds to say thanks to the maintainers that allow us to do our best work.

## About MacAdmins.io

[MacAdmins.io](https://macadmins.io) is the basic entrypoint with brief information to contact the board. However, the pages and projects on GitHub represent the work for the MacAdmins community, providing resources, documentation, and access to selected and community backed open source projects that may help Apple device management professionals worldwide. 

## Open Source Contributions

The MacAdmins community maintains an extensive collection of open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/macadmins).
